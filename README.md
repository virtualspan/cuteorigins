An ***unofficial*** server-side "port" of the Origin's mod, built with Bedrock & vanilla support.

## ⚠️ WARNING!

While I can't stop you from doing so, I wouldn't recommend using this mod on a server with untrusted players. This mod is in it's alpha stages, as I wrote 3/4ths of this mod at three in the morning for my private server and there are almost certainly bugs in it. If you find one of these and would like to help out, make an issue or a pull request.

While most origins work with Bedrock, about a quarter of them do not. Bedrock lacks a lot of necessary attributes and unfortunately I didn't have enough time to work around all of them. Here is a current list of known issues, if you are a developer and would like to help out, please do so!

- Enderians are not given extra reach on Bedrock
- Merlings are not given the swim speed boost nor the underwater breaking speed buff on Bedrock
- Phantom is almost completely broken on Bedrock
- Elytrians cannot wear a chestplate, however they are allowed to wear heavier armor to offset this.

## 📝 Features

- All the base Origins in addition to the ability to add them via datapacks (look at the `src/resources/data/cuteorigins/` folder for an example of structure)
- Orb of Origin is implemented (though it is not craftable, you can add a recipe using a datapack)
- Native Bedrock menu system
- "Keybind" system (`/cuteorigins binds`)

## 🔨 Usage

1. Install the mod on a 1.21.4 Fabric server along with the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
2. Log onto the server and pick your origin!
